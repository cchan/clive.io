## About

<!--use a real photo of myself somewhere in this region-->

I'm a primarily self-taught full-stack programmer with a strong intuition for solving hard problems
and a passion for reaching out to my community to share my love of science and technology.
I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo in the Software Engineering Co-op program.
